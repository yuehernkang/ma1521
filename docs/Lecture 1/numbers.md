Real Numbers and Functions

### Definition of Real Numbers:

- Real numbers are denoted by $\reals$. Thus, $\reals$ includes the integers
  - $\dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3$

- Rational numbers are in the form $\frac{p}{q}$ where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $(q \not ={0})$

- Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be expressed in fraction form
  - e.g. $\sqrt{2}, \pi, e$


- a $\in \reals$ means a is a member of the set $\reals$. In other words, a is a **real number**.

### Intervals
- Given two real numbers **a** and **b**, with $a < b$, the **closed interval** $[a,b]$ consists of all $x$ such that $a \le x \le b$, and the **open interval** $(a,b)$ consists of all x such that $a < x < b$
- **Closed Interval** : Include $a$ & $b$ $(a,b)$
- **Open Interval** : Don't include $a$ & $b$ $[a,b]$
- **Half-open Intervals** : 
  - $[a,b)$ $=$ $a\le x < b$
  - $(a,b]$ $=$ $a<x\le b$


### Absolute Value

- The absolute value of a number $a \in \reals$ is written as $|a|$ and is defined as :
  - $\begin{cases}
      a&\text{if } a \ge 0 \\
      -a &\text{if } a < 0
  \end{cases}$
- For example, $|2| = 2, |-2| = 2$
- \* Forget the sign, just retain the 'absolute' part of the number
- **Important Properties** :
  - $|-x| = |x|$, for all $x \in \reals$
  - $|xy| = |x||y|$, for all $x,y \in \reals$
  - $-|x| \leq x \leq |x|$, for all $x \in \reals$
  - For a fixed $r > 0$, $|x| < r$ if and only if $x \in (-r, r)$.
  - $\sqrt{x^2} = |x|$, $x \in \reals$, if x is negative, after squaring, it will be positive!
  - (Triangle Inequality) $|x + y| \leq |x| + |y|$ for all $x, y \in \reals$
  
### Example

Solve the inequality $\frac{2x-1}{2x+1} < 1$

1. $\frac{2x-1}{2x+1} < 1$
2. $0 < 1 - \frac{2x-1}{2x+1}$ (Bring the fraction over)
3. $0 < \frac{2x+1-2x+1}{2x+1}$ (Simplify)
4. $0 < \frac{2}{2x+1}$ (Simplify pt.2)
5. $0 < 2x + 1$ (2x + 1 must be greater than 0 as it is a fraction)
6. $-\frac{1}{2} < x$ (Solve for x)

- x must be greater than $-\frac{1}{2}$ so that the denominator of the fraction will not be 0
